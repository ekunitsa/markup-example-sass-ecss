# Markup example. Landing page.

With some nuances:
- camelCase;
- desktop first;
- "is-" handle states;
- At the time when I developed this layout - I worked in a company where several sites could be under one admin panel (multi-site). That's why we used the prefix as a unique site identifier. Here I kept this logic when developing. "gst-" is a unique site identifier which means "German Standard".
