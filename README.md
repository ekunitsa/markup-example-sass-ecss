# Markup example. Landing page.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an outdated markup. It shows an example of using sass together with the ecss approach. I did a refactoring of it in the end of 2023, but, nothing more than that. It was actually implemented around beginning of 2021 (and added to the github some time later) for the portfolio.
